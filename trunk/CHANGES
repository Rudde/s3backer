    - Retry on all HTTP error codes, not just 500 or greater. Tests show that
      a valid request can return a 4xx response due to network issues.
    - Allow FUSE create() and unlink() to "succeed" but actually do nothing.
    - Support 'E' for 'exabytes'.
    - Port to Mac OS 

Version 1.0.3 released 30 June 2008

    - Implement exponential backoff: replace ``--maxRetry'' and ``--retryPause''
      with ``--initialRetryPause'' and ``--maxRetryPause''.
    - Fix `--accessType' flag which was not being properly handled.
    - Improvements to the man page.

Version 1.0.1 released 20 June 2008

    - Store filesystem size in meta-data associated with the first block and
