TODO

- compressed GETs and PUTs using Content-Encoding and Accept-Encoding headers
- interrupt active write when new write happens (instead of waiting)
- allow block cache to live on disk and persist (possibly dirty) across restarts
- support alternate backends, generalize `--test' to `--backend=localfs', etc.
