#summary Other S3 filesystems

Here is a list of other projects that use Amazon S3 to create a Linux filesystem:

 * [http://code.google.com/p/s3ql/ s3ql]: open source S3 backed file system optimized for backups
 * [http://code.google.com/p/s3fs/ s3fs]: file-oriented filesystem backed by S3 written in C++
 * [http://www.elasticdrive.com/ ElasticDrive]: a commercial "distributed remove storage application" capable of using S3
 * [http://www.persistentfs.com/ PersistentFS]: an S3-backed filesystem, seems to be non open-source.
 * [https://fedorahosted.org/s3fs/ s3fs]: another "s3fs", but this one is written in python
 * [http://code.google.com/p/s3fs-fuse/ s3fs-fuse]: another S3 filesystem written in python

Note also that Amazon's [http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=689343011&me=A36L942TSJ2AJA Elastic Block Store] allows you to mount S3-backed filesystems on EC2 instances. This is a great way to get roughly the same effect that *s3backer* gives you, as long as you don't mind only having access to your data from an EC2 instance.
