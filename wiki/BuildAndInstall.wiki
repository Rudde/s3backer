#summary How to build and install s3backer

=== Requirements ===

*s3backer* requires the following additional packages:

|| *Name* || *Description* || *Home Page* ||
|| libcurl-devel || HTTP library for C || http://curl.haxx.se/ ||
|| fuse-devel || User-space filesystems || http://fuse.sourceforge.net/ ||
|| libopenssl-devel || Encryption library || http://www.openssl.org/ ||
|| zlib-devel || Compression library || http://www.zlib.net/ ||
|| libexpat-devel || XML parsing library || http://expat.sourceforge.net/ ||
|| pkg-config || Software library manager || http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/ ||

On various different systems, these may be already installed and/or have different package names.

==== Requirements On Ubuntu ====

This should be all that's required for Ubuntu:

{{{
$ sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libfuse-dev libexpat1-dev
}}}

==== Requirements On Mac OS X ====

Versions of *s3backer* prior to 1.3.1 rely on the [http://www.macports.org/ MacPorts] package infrastructure. First, install !MacPorts itself, then use !MacPorts to install the other missing requirements:

{{{
$ sudo port install pkgconfig fuse
}}}

*s3backer* versions 1.3.1 and later do not require !MacPorts. Instead, install MacFUSE using the {{{.dmg}}} installer. You can install {{{pkg-config}}} any way you like (including using !MacPorts) as long as the {{{./configure}}} script can find it on your {{{$PATH}}}.

Then follow the instructions below for *Building And Installing From Source* except you'll need to run the {{{./configure}}} script like this:

{{{
$ PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig ./configure
}}}

*NOTE:* MacFUSE 2.0.3 has a bug. You should enable "Show beta versions" in the MacFUSE system preferences widget and update to version 2.1.5 or later.

*NOTE:* If you still get errors, edit {{{/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/fuse.pc}}} and change the {{{-lfuse}}} to {{{-lfuse_ino64}}}, then reconfigure and rebuild:

{{{
$ PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig ./configure
$ make clean && make
$ sudo make install
}}}

=== Installing Using Pre-Built RPMs ===

If you are running [http://www.opensuse.org/ openSUSE] or a few other Linux variants, you can find pre-built RPMs on the openSUSE build server [http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/archie172/ here].

=== Building And Installing From Source ===

Like lots of other software packages, *s3backer* uses [http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/ GNU Autoconf] for its build process so once you have installed the other required packages, building and installing *s3backer* is usually as easy as:

{{{
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
}}}

=== FUSE Configuration ===

If you want to allow normal users to mount *s3backer* filesystems, you need to add the {{{user_allow_other}}} option to {{{/etc/fuse.conf}}}. It must be on a line by itself.

For example:

{{{
$ sudo sh -c 'echo user_allow_other >> /etc/fuse.conf'
}}}
