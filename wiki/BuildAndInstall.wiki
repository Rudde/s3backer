#summary How to build and install s3backer

=== Requirements ===

*s3backer* requires the following additional packages:

|| *Name* || *Description* || *Home Page* ||
|| libcurl-devel || HTTP library for C || http://curl.haxx.se/ ||
|| fuse-devel || User-space filesystems || http://fuse.sourceforge.net/ ||
|| libopenssl-devel || Encryption library || http://www.openssl.org/ ||
|| zlib-devel || Compression library || http://www.zlib.net/ ||
|| libexpat-devel || XML parsing library || http://expat.sourceforge.net/ ||
|| pkg-config || Software library manager || http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/ ||

On various different systems, these may be already installed and/or have different package names.

==== Ubuntu ====

This should be all that's required for Ubuntu:

{{{
$ sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libfuse-dev libexpat1-dev
}}}

==== Mac OS X ====

Versions of *s3backer* prior to 1.3.1 rely on the [http://www.macports.org/ MacPorts] package infrastructure. First, install !MacPorts itself, then use !MacPorts to install the other missing requirements:

{{{
$ sudo port install pkg-config fuse
}}}

*s3backer* versions 1.3.1 and later do not require !MacPorts. Instead, install MacFUSE using the {{{.dmg}}} installer. You can install {{{pkg-config}}} any way you like as long as the {{{./configure}}} script can find it on your {{{$PATH}}}. To build and install from source, follow the in [http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/wiki/HOWTO#1._Install_pkg-config install pkg-config instructions] on the MacFUSE wiki.

See also the [http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/wiki/HOWTO#Compiling_Other_FUSE_File_Systems_Written_for_Linux Compiling Other FUSE File Systems Written for Linux] wiki section.

=== Installing Using Pre-Built RPMs ===

If you are running [http://www.opensuse.org/ openSUSE] or a few other Linux variants, you can find pre-built RPMs on the openSUSE build server [http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/archie172/ here].

=== Building From Source ===

Like lots of other software packages, *s3backer* uses [http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/ GNU Autoconf] for its build process so once you have installed the other required packages, building and installing *s3backer* is usually as easy as:

{{{
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
}}}

=== FUSE Configuration ===

If you want to allow normal users to mount *s3backer* filesystems, you need to add the {{{user_allow_other}}} option to {{{/etc/fuse.conf}}}. It must be on a line by itself.

For example:

{{{
$ sudo sh -c 'echo user_allow_other >> /etc/fuse.conf'
}}}
