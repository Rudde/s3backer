#summary How to mount the demo filesystem
#labels Featured

A demonstration ext2 filesystem has been created that you can mount read-only using *s3backer* on any Linux machine.

*No Amazon S3 account is required!*

This mechanism can be used to provide humongous world-readable (read-only) filesystems that can be easily mounted by users the world over. Might be a useful way to publicize all kinds of file-based information.

To see the demo, first build and install *s3backer*.

===Linux Users====

Run these commands:

{{{
$ mkdir s3b.mnt demo.mnt
$ s3backer -o allow_other s3backer-demo s3b.mnt
s3backer: warning: no accessId specified; only read operations will succeed
s3backer: auto-detecting block size and total file size...
s3backer: auto-detected block size=4k and total size=20m
$ sudo mount -o ro,loop s3b.mnt/file demo.mnt
$ cat demo.mnt/README
}}}

You will then be able to see the files in the demo filesystem.

===Mac OS Users===

Run these commands:

{{{
$ mkdir s3b.mnt
$ s3backer --filename=demo.dmg --prefix=macos s3backer-demo s3b.mnt
s3backer: warning: no accessId specified; only read operations will succeed
s3backer: auto-detecting block size and total file size...
s3backer: auto-detected block size=4k and total size=640k
}}}

You will then see {{{demo.dmg}}} inside the {{{s3b.mnt}}} directory, which is a Mac OS disk image you can then mount normally.
