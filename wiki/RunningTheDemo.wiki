#summary How to mount the demo filesystem

A demonstration filesystem has been created that you can mount read-only using *s3backer*. No Amazon S3 account is required!

To see the demo, first build and install *s3backer* on a Linux machine.

Then, run these commands:

{{{
$ mkdir s3b.mnt demo.mnt
$ s3backer -o allow_other s3backer-demo s3b.mnt
s3backer: warning: no accessId specified; only read operations will succeed
s3backer: auto-detecting block size and total file size...
s3backer: auto-detected block size=4k and total size=20m
$ sudo mount -o ro,loop s3b.mnt/file demo.mnt
$ cat demo.mnt/README
}}}

You will then be able to see the files in the demo filesystem.
