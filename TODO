TODO

- compressed GETs and PUTs using Content-Encoding and Accept-Encoding headers
- interrupt active write when new write happens (instead of waiting)
- include 'known_zero' flag in read and write s3backer_store methods
- allow block cache block data to live in a memory mapped file instead of heap.
- support alternate backends, generalize `--test' to `--backend=localfs', etc.
